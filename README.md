# VCF Contacts Plugin for Obsidian
Introducing the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Contacts Plugin! With this plugin, you can easily organize and manage your contacts within [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Simply create a note within the contacts folder and use the plugin's features to quickly add to, search, link and sort through your contacts. Contacts plugin also helps you to organize, import, and export to for example email clients or google contacts, remember birthdays and more.

üìå Installation

üîÑ Automatic (Community Plugins)

    Open Obsidian Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins
    Disable Safe Mode if enabled
    Click Browse, search for "VCF Contacts"
    Click Install and then Enable

üì• Manual Installation

    Download from github main.js, manifest.json, and styles.css from the Releases.
    Create a folder in your Obsidian vault:
    üìÇ <VaultFolder>/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-vcf-contacts
    Move the downloaded files into this folder.
    Restart Obsidian and enable the plugin in Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins.

üöÄ Usage

Once enabled, the plugin allows you to import, export, and manage contacts within Obsidian.
üîπ Before You Start: Set Up a Contacts Folder

To keep your contacts organized, create a dedicated contacts folder and set it in the plugin settings:

    Open Settings in Obsidian.
    Navigate to the Contacts tab.
    Set "Contacts Folder Location" to an existing folder.

üì• Importing a vCard or Contact Database

    Open the Contacts sidebar from the left main dock.
    The Contacts plugin interface will appear, displaying the main functions at the top.
    Click "Import VCF" and load your .vcf file (single or database).
    If your contact data is inconsistent (which is common üòâ), you'll be prompted to enter:
        Given Name (First Name)
        Family Name (Last Name)
        These fields are required, as they are used as the main identifier within the plugin.

üì§ Exporting a vCard

    Click the "Export VCF" button in the Contacts plugin interface or on a single contact.
    Choose where to save the .vcf file.
    The file will be generated in vCard 4.0 format.

üñºÔ∏è Importing Avatars

You can add avatars to your contacts in two ways:

    From a Local File: Press process avatar button. Select an image file (e.g. .jpg, .png).
    From a URL: Paste in the image URL directly in the PHOTO property and then press process avatar button. 

    The process avatar button will minimize, scale and include the avatars to obsidion Vault-Local Storage 

üìû Click-to-Call & Quick Copy

    Click on a phone number or email address to initiate a call or open your email client.
    Right-click on any displayed property and select "Copy to Clipboard" to quickly copy the value.

‚ûï Creating a New Contact from Scratch

    Click the "Create Contact" button in the Contacts plugin interface.
    Enter Given Name and Family Name (required).
    Add additional contact details (phone, email, address, etc. etc.).
    Your contact is now saved in Obsidian and can be exported as a .vcf file when needed.
    Feel free to add more data as long as they match with the VCF schema patterns.
    It's just another obsidian markdown file so link, write as you prefer.


üîé Searching for Contacts

If you, like me, have more than a thousand contacts, a quick search is essential. Fortunately, Obsidian‚Äôs Quick Switcher makes finding contacts instant and effortless.

üîπ Using the Quick Switcher

    Press Ctrl + O (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + O (Mac).
    Start typing a part of the contact‚Äôs name.
    Select the contact from the list and press Enter to open it.
    The contacts overview will automatically scroll to the selected contact card.

This method ensures that you can quickly navigate to any contact without manually searching through your files. üöÄ

# üìñ Understanding the vCard (VCF) Format

The **vCard (VCF) format** is a widely used **standard for storing and exchanging contact information**. It allows for structured data, including names, phone numbers, email addresses, profile photos, and more.

For an in-depth explanation, refer to the **official vCard 4.0 specification**:  
üìú **[RFC 6350](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6350)**
